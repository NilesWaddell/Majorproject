# Proposal
I want to create a semi simple fan game based on the flash game "There is NO Game"

## Must Have
- Multiple seperate scenes with different things that interact with one another
- some form of explanatory audio
## Good to Have
- Nice/funny audio
- good sprites
- sub titles
- different languages
