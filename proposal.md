# Proposal
I want to create a simple fan game based on the flash game "There is NO Game"

## Must Have
- One complete first section
- collision detection
- mouse detection as an object within the game

## Good to Have
- Nice/funny audio
- good sprites
- sub titles
- different languages
- Multiple seperate scenes with different things that interact with one another
